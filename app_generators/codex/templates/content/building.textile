    @rake html/xxx.html@
    
* If you’ve created a @content/table_of_contents.textile@, build the whole presentation with

    @rake all@
    
  The output will be in @html/all.html@
  
h1. Running the Presentation

* Simply open the appropriate HTML file

* See the "S5 documentation":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ for details

* Some hints—
** arrow keys and space bar work
** type the slide number to jump
** mouse over the bottom right to bring up a set of controls and a list of all available slides
** most IR and radio clickers seem to work OK
** resizing your browser fonts works well to make stuff fit during the presentation
