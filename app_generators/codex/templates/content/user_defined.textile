h1. User-defined filters and post processors

h1(slide0). User-defined filters

Create your own tags

h1. User-defined filters

* Allow you to create your own @filters@ and @tags@
* They go in the @filters/@ directory
* There already is an example filter there

h1. Example filter

<div style="width: 50%; float: right">

:code filters/example_filter.rb[class=code-small]

</div>

<div style="width: 49%">

* Declare a class which inherits from @Codex::Filter@
** Set the tag you wish to use
** Implement @filter_inline(text,args)@ 
** Implement @filter_single(args)@
** You can omit filter_single if you just want it to load a file and parse it through filter_inline

</div>

It's _that_ simple.

h1. Using your filter

You can now use your tags in your slides:

:inlinecode
 :inlinetest
  Reverse this text
 :endinlinetest
:endinlinecode

The result is:

:inlinetest
Reverse this text
:endinlinetest


h1(slide0). User defined Post Processors

Make your own changes to the slides after they are built

h1. User defined Post Processors

* Allow you to alter the generated HTML to your content
* You can use an HTML parser such as "Hpricot":http://github.com/whymirror/hpricot to make complex modifications or @String#gsub@ to make simple changes
* They go in the @post_processors/@ directory
* There are sample Post Processors defined in this directory

h1. How to create your own Post Processor

<div style="width: 50%; float: right">

:code post_processors/upcase_titles.rb[class=code-tiny]

</div>

<div style="width: 49%">

* Declare a class which inherits from @Codex::PostProcessor@
* Run the @register@ class method on top of the class declaration (commented in the example)
* Implement @process()@ 
* Manipulate the @html@ string variable. Whatever is held in @html@ will be passed on to the slides parser (and maybe to other Post Processors).

</div>

h1. Using the example

* Simply uncomment @# register@ and regenerate the slides using @rake@ (you may need to delete the old @.html@ files in @html/@)
* You will see that all titles are now in UPCASE.
* If you want to control the order that Post Processors are applied, name their files incrementally (ex.: @01_process_code.rb@, @02_process_text.rb@, etc)
