h1. The Basics

h1. Content and Code

* Content is created using "Textile markup":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/
* Code is written as normal source files
* Content can embed parts of the source files
* It's all processed into an HTML-based presentation


h1. Presentation Metadata

* Required file @config/metadata.yml@

:code config/metadata.yml

h1. Where Stuff Goes

* Create your content in @content/xxx.textile@
* Write code under @code/xxx@
* Build the files @html/xxx.html@ by running @Rake@


h1. @.textile@ files

* Each @.textile@ file is a separate chunk of the presentation
* The first @h1.@ heading is the banner page for that chunk
* Each subsequent @h1.@ starts a new slide
* Using @h1(slide0).@ will create a title slide, like the first slide in every file


h1. Table of Contents

<div style="width:40%; float:right;">
:code content/table_of_contents.textile[class=code-tiny]
</div>

<div style="width:58%">
* You can divide your material into segments, each in a separate @xxx.textile@ file
* Then create @content/table_of_contents.textile@, eg:
</div>
