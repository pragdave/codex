This is a remarkably trivial package that makes simply HTML-based presentations from
a set up source files written using Textile. It's designed to help when creating
slides that contain lots of code, as it allows code to be embedded from external source files. 
This means that the code that you embed can come from running (and tested) programs.

The code in the resulting slides is syntax highlighted, and is hyperlinked to the original
source file, allowing that file to be brought up in Textmate.

To get started

* make sure you have Ruby 1.8.6 installed, along with the Rake and redcloth gems
* type 'rake all' in the same directory as this README file
* open html/all.html


See the file LICENSE for details on how this all may be used.
